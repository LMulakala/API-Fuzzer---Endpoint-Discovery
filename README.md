# API Fuzzer - Endpoint Discovery #

# About
This project is my exploration into the world of cybersecurity through practical coding. I wanted to dive into cybersecurity concepts by building a cybersecurity tool commonly used in the industry - an API fuzzer tailored for endpoint discovery. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let's briefly touch on some fundamental concepts:

## What is an API?
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## What is an API Fuzzer?
An API fuzzer is a testing tool used to identify potential vulnerabilities or issues in an API by sending a variety of unexpected or malformed requests.

## What is Endpoint Discovery?
Endpoint discovery refers to the process of identifying and exploring the various endpoints exposed by an API, including URLs, paths, and parameters.

### Domains, Subdomains, and Paths
In this project, we utilize a combination of domains, subdomains, and paths to construct URLs for endpoint discovery. Here's a brief overview:

- **Domains:** The basic address of the API, such as "http" or "https".
- **Subdomains:** Additional prefixes to the domain that organize or distinguish different parts of an application, such as “google” or “login”.
- **Paths:** Specific routes or endpoints within the API that serve different functionalities or resources, such as “.net” or “/api”.

### Main Functionality
The primary focus of this API fuzzer is to check the existence of URLs constructed from the provided domains, subdomains, and paths. The main steps include:

1. Constructing URLs from combinations of domains, subdomains, and paths.
2. Sending HTTP requests to each URL to see if it exists.
3. Retrieving and analyzing the response code returned by the server.

# The Reasons

## Why Did I Make It?
In my profile, I've mentioned that I'm a high school student with a keen interest in cybersecurity and coding. Although I'm relatively new to the cybersecurity scene, I saw an opportunity to merge my passions and deepen my understanding of both fields through practical application. However, I couldn't have come up with the idea on my own, as the credit goes to my mentor, an experienced information security architect. With my mentor’s guidance, I embarked on the development of this API fuzzer, using it as a means to not only grasp fundamental cybersecurity concepts but also to refine my coding abilities. His knowledge of cybersecurity has led him to mentor me through the program I am in, the Independent Study and Mentorship program. In this program, you have a choice of choosing any career to focus on to study for a school year. As part of the Independent Study and Mentorship program, I worked to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity. I was able to learn from the program because it enabled me to channel my interests and translate them into a tangible project, my API Fuzzer. Through the program, I was able to acquire hands-on experience and mentorship, ultimately empowering me to make informed decisions about my future career choices.

## What's the Point?
Developing an API fuzzer isn't just about personal growth; it's about strengthening cybersecurity practices. Think of it like having a powerful tool for pinpointing weaknesses in software. APIs, which are the backbone of many digital systems, are frequently targeted by hackers. By mastering the use of an API fuzzer, I'm acquiring a valuable skill that allows me to identify and address these vulnerabilities effectively. Through this project, I'm not just learning about cybersecurity principles; I'm actively engaging in the process of fortifying digital applications against potential threats.

## Importance in Cybersecurity
API security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. Effectively testing and securing APIs is essential for protecting sensitive data and preventing security breaches. With the increasing reliance on APIs in modern software development, understanding their vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them is more crucial than ever. My project is just one component in the larger landscape of API fuzzing techniques, which collectively play a vital role in enhancing the security of digital systems.

## Future Steps
I plan to continue to develop and refine this API fuzzer, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Your input will help me improve the tool and learn more in the process, so please reach out if you have any suggestions!
